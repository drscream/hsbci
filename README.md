# HsBCI - a HBCI library for Haskell

HsBCI aims to be a simple, modular and fast library which implements
the German [*Home Banking Computer Interface* (HBCI) / *Financial
Transaction Services* (FinTS) protocol](http://www.hbci-zka.de/).

## Status

HsBCI is under heavy development and does not do anything useful right
now. You cannot use it to talk to your bank yet :(
